# AlphArmada
AlphArmada - AlphaZero training method for Star Wars: Armada
Using H-MCTS and H-DL

Currently developing basic MCTS model, applying stochastic attack dice result.

Developed so far...
- Activate Ship
- Declare Target
- Determine Maneuver

Next Move?
- AI Structure
  - Hierarchical MCTS structure
  - Deep Learning model for AlphaZero algorithm
  - Information-Set MCTS structure

- Game Mechanism
  - Obstruction (Dice Remove)
  - Defense Token
  - Squadron
  - Command Dial / Command Token
