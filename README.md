# AlphArmada
AlphArmada - AlphaZero training method for Star Wars: Armada
Using MCTS and H-DL

Currently developing basic MCTS model, applying stochastic attack dice result.

Developed so far...
- Activate Ship
- Attack Step (/w defense tokens)
- Execute Maneuver Step
- Command Dial / Command Token

Next Move?
- AI Structure
  - Hierarchical MCTS structure
  - Deep Learning model for AlphaZero algorithm
  - Information-Set MCTS structure

- Game Mechanism
  - Squadron
  - Obstacle
  - Damage Cards (chance node?)
  - Upgrades
